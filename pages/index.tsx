            <p>
              Elias together with two other Cygni talents created a web application for booking rooms and desks at the
              Cygni Syd office using mob-programming. The application uses a React Frontend with Google SSO and
              connections to the Google Calender API as backend. A simple node.js express backend with sqlite was also
              written during development for testing purposes. The application was then deployed using AWS Amplify.

              Axis Communications AB is a Swedish manufacturer of network based solutions in the areas of physical
              safety and camera surveillance. I did my master thesis in monitoring of large scale distributed software
              systems. The goal of the thesis was to explore the possibilities of discovering different types of network
              faults between the nodes in the systems, both within and outside kubernetes clusters using a recent
              technology, service mesh. This involved creating a virtualized test-environment consisting of multiple
              virtual machines running different services, connected through a simulated network where faults could be
              introduced. A series of tests were carried out in order to evaluate if the faults could be discovered
              using the service mesh. The result of the master thesis was that network faults could to some extent be
              discovered using the solution and could be applicable in some cases. The problems experienced were mainly
              due to using service mesh in a way it is not intended for.
