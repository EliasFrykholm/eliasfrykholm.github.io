              Elias together with two other Cygni talents created a web application for booking rooms and desks at the

              written during development for testing purposes. The application was then deployed using AWS Amplify.

              Neo4J, Docker, AWS
            </h3>
            <p>
              This was a personal project where i wanted to develop a mobile app for recommending movies, with the main
              purpose of trying out some new technologies that i hadnt worked with previously such as graph database,
              recommendation engines and Flutter.
            </p>
            <p>
              The application is built using the cross-platform framework Flutter and has only been tested on Android
              but the framework should allow it to be exported for browser and ios. The backend is built using Java with
              Spring Boot and consits of two microservices, one for all interactions towards the TMDB api and one for
              database interactions towards the Neo4J graph database and providing recommendations. The recommendation
              engine works by finding movies that other users has liked that has a history of likeing previous movies
              that the current user also has liked.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a user first opens the application, they are presented with a genre selection screen where they can
              pick genres that they prefer. The selected genres are mainly used for the initial recommendations but is
              also weighed in for future recommendations. After that, a movie artwork is shown based on the calculated
              recommendation and the user can either swipe right or left on the artwork to like or dislike the movie.
              The user is also able to click on the artwork to get the movie description, see TMDB rating and a button
              to watch the trailer. If there are no recommendations for the current user, the application fetches movies
              from the TMDB toplist and adds them to the recommendation engine for future users. There is no sign in
              required for the application, it only uses an unique id based on the device to identify the user.
            </p>

            <p>
              The application heavily relies on the open api movie database TMDB (<a>https://www.themoviedb.org/</a>)
              which serves all the movie data.

            <p>
              This was a personal project where i developed a notes application inspired by Google Keep, with the main
              purpose of improving my skills or trying some new technologies technologies such as Microservice
              Architecture, AWS, Kubernetes, Golang, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Terraform.
            </p>
            <p>
              The frontend for the application is built using React and the backend consists two services, one
              authentification service (written in Golang) and one service for handling the notes (written in java) and
              a MongoDB database for storing notes and user data. The application was deployed to an AWS EKS cluster
              using Terraform and the process is fully automated with Github Actions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The frontend is a React application and is a traditional note taking interface built with Material UI
              displaying all the users notes, allows for editing of the notes, changing colors, token refreshing,
              searching for notes and with a login/signup component. The authentication for this application is built
              from scratch and utilizes JWT tokens and this is handled by the authentication service. Its
              resposibilities are logins, signups, token validation and token refreshing. The notes service handles all
              updates to the notes and all api calls made to it is verified through the authentication service by the
              JWT token passed in the api calls before updating the note content in the MongoDB database. A large focus
              in this project was the deployment, the deployment to AWS EKS is done using terraform and all
              infrastructure and setup are specified in the terraform files. The application can be fully deployed with
              a single terraform command and just as easily destroyed again in order to reduce the AWS bill since the
              application is developed for learning purposes. Github actions is setup to build the application, build
              docker images, publish the docker images and either deploy or update the infrastructure on AWS.

            <h2>Dig-Bot</h2>

            <p>
              Me together with some colleages at Cygni developed a game called Dig-Bot, it is a
              semi-multiplayer/realtime game which tests the players coding skills. The game consists of a frontend
              built using react, a backend server in Java, and several client templates created in different popular
              languages.
            </p>
            <p>
              The gist of the game is that you are multiple players on a vertically autoscrolling 2D game map, the
              players should dig their way down through the ground as far as possible but there are several objects
              randomly scattered throughout the map. There are pick-up items in the map such as explosives and extra
              points and there are stones in your way that cant be dug but can be destroyed with explosives. You also
              got to watch out for other players as they can destroy you by colliding with you or by explosives.
            </p>
            <p>
              The game works by a server rendering the map which is served to the frontend and handling all game logic,
              there are multiple clients connected through the server (players) which performs actions for the players.
              The players objective is to download a client in their preferred coding language which has some predefined
              functions they can use for deciding their move such as getting the layout of the map, getting other player
              locations, getting their explosive count and performing a move. The player should then implement a bot
              using these predefined functions for making the best game move for every game-tick. So when the game is
              started the players moves by their predefined bots and the frontend is just a visible presentation of the
              current game status. As the game progresses, the map gets harder to navigate and the number of explosives
              decrease. The game is over when there are no players left and the winner is the player with the highest
              score which is based on collected points and the depth they got to.

              This webpage is built using Next.js and automatically deployed to Github pages through Github Actions. The
              components and styiling are custom built with CSS and SVG graphics, you might already have noticed but
              there is a parallaxing effect on the background and the wavy sections move when you scroll. Colors for the
              sections is somewhat autogenerated. The page is built to be easily editable.
