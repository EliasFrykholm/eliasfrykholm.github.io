I did my master thesis in monitoring of large scale distributed software systems. The goal of the thesis was to explore the possibilities of discovering different types of network faults between the nodes in the systems, both within and outside kubernetes clusters using a recent technology, service mesh. This involved creating a virtualized test-environment consisting of multiple virtual machines running different services, connected through a simulated network where faults could be introduced.
