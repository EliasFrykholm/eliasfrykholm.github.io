I did my master thesis in monitoring of large scale distributed software systems. The goal of the thesis was to explore the possibilities of discovering different types of network faults between the nodes in the systems, both within and outside kubernetes clusters using a recent technology, service mesh. This involved creating a virtualized test-environment consisting of multiple virtual machines running different services, connected through a simulated network where faults could be introduced. A series of tests were carried out in order to evaluate if the faults could be discovered using the service mesh. The result of the master thesis was that network faults could to some extent be discovered using the solution and could be applicable in some cases.
